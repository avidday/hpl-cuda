See the accompanying COPYING file for full details of the
license and copyright information of the code contained in
this distribution.

This distribution contains a simple acceleration scheme for
the standard HPL-2.0 benchmark with a double precision capable
NVIDIA GPU and the CUBLAS library.

The code has been known to build on Ubuntu 8.04LTS or later and Redhat 5
and derivatives, using mpich2 and GotoBLAS, with CUDA 2.2 or later.

The supplied Make.CUDA file relies on a number of environment variables
being set to correctly locate host BLAS and MPI, and CUBLAS libraries
and include files. Example values for the abovementioned mpich2 and gotoBLAS
combinations might be:

MPICH2_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/mpich2-1.3
MPICH2_INCLUDES=-I/opt/mpich2-1.3/include
MPICH2_LIBRARIES=-L/opt/mpich2-1.3/lib -lmpich -lmpl
BLAS_INCLUDES=-I/opt/goto/GotoBLAS2/include
BLAS_LIBRARIES=-L/opt/goto/GotoBLAS2/lib -lgoto2 -lgfortran -lpthread
CUBLAS_INCLUDES=-I/opt/cuda-3.2/include
CUBLAS_LIBRARIES=-L/opt/cuda-3.2/lib64 -lcublas -lcudart -lcuda

With these set, it should be possible to build by issuing

$ make arch=CUDA

which will drop the final xhpl executable in the bin/CUDA directory.
Correct runtime path and link load settings are the responsibility
of the user.

NOTE:

This version of the code only acclerates one section
of the factorization for a single GPU. The scheduling routine
gpuUpdatePlanCreate() in auxil/HPL_gpusupport.c contains two
tuning constants tune0 and tune1, which control the split
of work between the GPU and host CPU(s). These must be tuned
for optimal performance with a given GPU and host CPU/BLAS
combination. How this is done is left as an exercise for the
reader.

There are a number of further optimizations which can be applied
to this code - it should be regarded as a starting point rather
than a definitive version of the benchmark.
